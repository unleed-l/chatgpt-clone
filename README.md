# chatgpt_clone

## Introduction

That's a chatgpt clone app writen in Flutter/Dart
to study how OpenAI API works.

## Setup

1. To use the OpenAI API a key is needed, so you'll need to create your own key.
You can do that on this [site](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
2. Create a .env file in the root of project and store your API key in a variable named "API_KEY".
